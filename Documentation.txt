Project name: Bus Reservatioin

Our cuurent goal is to develop an application code which will support the Reservation of Bus tickets 
Programming Language Used: CPP with Object Oriented
Authors: MANIDEEP, CHARAN MC

Current Progress achieved:
 As of now we have completed only basic functions of the code,and many functions are yet to be defined and declared
 
Algorithm followed:( how the application works)

1.Starts here
//USER LOGIN
2.Welcome screen appears with signin and signup options
3.if he chose the sign in the user is prompted with login screen to signin with the account credentials,
4.If he doesnt have an account earlier,he can choose the sign up option to create new account
//AFTER Succesfully logging in
5. Menu appears with the below options (Menus heads as MC BUS Reservation)
   1.Search Buses
   2.View Past bookings
   3.Cancel Ticket
   
 Search Bus Option:
 1.User is asked to enter and choose the FROM,TO stations and the date of Journey..
 2.then the available buses will be shown along with some details like (Journey Timing,Fare,Arrival and Departure Timings,no of seats available)
 3.the user may choose any of the available options according to the convience of him
 4.after he chooses the bus,he will be displayed with the seats available
 5.the user may chose the seat
 6.for simplicity there is no any payment interface(LOL the customer is getting free tickets,cheerioo we are doing a free service to the customers)
 7.Once the booking is completed,that seat is marked for block and will be recorded as filled.
 8.A unique booking id is generated for the ticket and is shown to the user.
 
 View Past Bookings:
 Every booking is linked to the user id and booking number
 When this button is clicked all the previous boookings made by the user are shown 
 
 Cancel Ticket:
 Tickets booked may be canceled 1 day before the date of Journey
 1.When this option is choosen,all the bookings whose date of jounery is less than the current next day's date,
 they will be shown
 2.User has to select which booking is to be cancelled
 3.once chosen, the selected ticket will stand cancelled
